Bowling demo application.

Application covered by unit tests.
I implemented multiplayer mode, it support count of players and players names




Applied instructions:

Write a Ruby on Rails API that takes score of bowling game.

Main requirements:

The API should be written using Ruby on Rails. In additional, it should provide the following:

* A way to start a new bowling game;
* A way to input the number of pins knocked down by each ball;
* A way to output the current game score (score for each frame and total score).

Imagine that this API will be used by a bowling house. On the screen the user starts the game, then after each throw the machine, with a sensor, counts how many pins were dropped and calls the API sending this information. In the meantime the screen is constantly (for example: every 2 seconds) asking the API for the current game status and displays it.
